            <dt>Hobbies and Interests</dt>
            <dd>In my spare time I like to research different topics and learn new things, this can be
              through the news, documentaries, internet and books. I have a passionate interest in history
              and space science for which I always find time to research on. I also like to play and watch
              a variety of sports mainly cricket and football. I am a proud member of a local cricket club
              for which I play every weekend and this has taught me to be organised, disciplined, responsible,
              and develop skills such as teamwork and leadership.</dd>
